Senior Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience building high-performance backend systems. I specialize in the Java ecosystem (Spring Boot, Java 8-21).

I thrive in solving complex architectural challenges. My track record includes architecting a fault-tolerant migration engine for 5TB of critical data (1M+ records) using multi-threading logic, optimizing database performance by 90%, and leading security initiatives to harden applications against vulnerabilities.

As a Technical Reference, I combine deep expertise in Distributed Systems (Kafka, AWS) to build systems that are not only fast but also secure and scalable.

Technical Stack:

Core & Backend: Java (8, 17, 21), Spring Boot, Wildfly, Multi-threading & Concurrency.

Architecture & Data: Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka, RabbitMQ), RESTful APIs, DDD, Hexagonal Architecture.

Database: Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL (Performance Tuning, High-Volume Migrations).

AI & Efficiency: GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Prompt Engineering, LLM-Assisted Refactoring.

DevOps & Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Docker, CI/CD Pipelines, Kubernetes concepts.

Objective: I am driven by technical excellence and seeking challenging roles as a Java Software Engineer where I can leverage architectural patterns to build scalable, high-availability solutions.
